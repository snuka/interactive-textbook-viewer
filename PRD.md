# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Interactive Textbook Viewer is a front-end only web application that provides an enhanced reading experience for textbook content. The application enables users to read chapters, create highlights and notes, generate flashcards from highlights, and interact with an AI sidekick for learning assistance. The system is designed to work offline as a PWA with all data persisted locally in the browser.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student, I want to read textbook chapters in a web interface, so that I can access my learning materials from any device with a browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to a chapter URL THEN the system SHALL display the chapter content from static HTML files
2. WHEN a user is reading a chapter THEN the system SHALL provide a table of contents sidebar for navigation
3. WHEN a user reaches the end of a chapter THEN the system SHALL provide previous/next navigation controls
4. WHEN a user views chapter content THEN the system SHALL display it with proper pagination and readable typography
5. IF a chapter does not exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want to highlight text and add notes while reading, so that I can mark important information for later review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects text in a chapter THEN the system SHALL provide highlighting options with different colors
2. WHEN a user creates a highlight THEN the system SHALL persist it to browser localStorage
3. WHEN a user clicks on a highlight THEN the system SHALL allow them to add or edit notes
4. WHEN a user returns to a chapter THEN the system SHALL display all previously created highlights
5. WHEN a user creates a note THEN the system SHALL associate it with the specific highlight and persist it locally
6. IF localStorage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and inform the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student, I want to generate flashcards from my highlights, so that I can review key concepts using spaced repetition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has created highlights THEN the system SHALL provide an option to generate flashcards from them
2. WHEN a user creates a flashcard THEN the system SHALL use the highlighted text as the question/answer content
3. WHEN a user reviews flashcards THEN the system SHALL present them in a flip-card interface
4. WHEN a user rates their recall (thumbs up/down) THEN the system SHALL implement Leitner bucket logic for spaced repetition
5. WHEN a user promotes a card THEN the system SHALL move it to the next review bucket with appropriate timing
6. WHEN a user demotes a card THEN the system SHALL move it to an earlier review bucket
7. WHEN it's time for review THEN the system SHALL only show cards that are due based on the Leitner algorithm

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student, I want to ask questions to an AI sidekick while reading, so that I can get immediate help understanding difficult concepts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the AI sidekick panel THEN the system SHALL display a chat interface
2. WHEN a user asks a question THEN the system SHALL return a response from pre-configured JSON data
3. WHEN a user asks an unrecognized question THEN the system SHALL display a default "learning" message
4. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL show a toast notification indicating "Real AI coming soon"
5. IF the AI stub data fails to load THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student, I want the application to work offline, so that I can continue studying without an internet connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL register a service worker for offline functionality
2. WHEN a user has visited pages before THEN the system SHALL cache static assets and JSON data locally
3. WHEN a user is offline THEN the system SHALL serve cached content without network requests
4. WHEN the application is installable THEN the system SHALL provide an "Install App" prompt
5. WHEN a user installs the app THEN the system SHALL function as a standalone PWA
6. IF cache storage fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to online-only mode

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a student, I want a polished user experience with accessibility features, so that I can use the application efficiently regardless of my abilities or preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user prefers dark mode THEN the system SHALL provide a dark mode toggle that persists their preference
2. WHEN a user uses keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL support keyboard shortcuts for common actions
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL achieve a Lighthouse PWA score of ≥90% and Performance score of ≥85%
4. WHEN a user with disabilities accesses the app THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG accessibility standards
5. WHEN a user interacts with UI elements THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate focus indicators and screen reader support
6. IF the user's browser doesn't support certain features THEN the system SHALL provide graceful fallbacks

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that I can maintain code quality and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL have ≥90% unit test coverage for functions and utilities
2. WHEN UI components are created THEN the system SHALL have React Testing Library tests for major UI states
3. WHEN core user flows are implemented THEN the system SHALL have Cypress e2e tests covering reader navigation, highlighting, and flashcard functionality
4. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL pass all unit, component, and e2e tests before deployment
5. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment until issues are resolved

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated deployment, so that I can ship updates quickly and reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN the system SHALL automatically run build and test processes
2. WHEN all tests pass THEN the system SHALL export the application as static files
3. WHEN the build succeeds THEN the system SHALL deploy to Vercel with automatic preview URLs
4. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL be accessible via CDN edge locations
5. IF the build or tests fail THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and notify the developer
